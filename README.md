# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation

This is a C++ implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST), a fundamental data structure for efficiently storing and managing a collection of elements. This program allows you to perform various operations on the BST, such as insertion, search, removal, and more.

## Features

- Insertion of elements into the BST.
- Searching for elements in the BST.
- Removal of elements from the BST.
- In-order, pre-order, and post-order tree traversals.
- Level-order traversal with and without queues.
- Calculation of the total height and depth of the tree.
- Counting the total number of nodes and leaf nodes in the tree.
- Determining whether the tree is a full, complete, or balanced BST.

## Usage

This BST program offers a simple interactive console interface to demonstrate the various operations it supports. Users can insert, search for, and remove elements from the BST. Additionally, the program provides information about the tree, such as traversals, height, depth, node counts, and tree type.

## BST Operations

The following operations are available in this BST implementation:

- Insertion of a value.
- Searching for a value.
- Removal of a value.
- In-order traversal.
- Pre-order traversal.
- Post-order traversal.
- Level-order traversal (with and without queues).
- Calculation of the total height of the tree.
- Calculation of the total depth of the tree.
- Counting the total number of nodes.
- Counting the number of leaf nodes.
- Determining the type of the tree (full, complete, or balanced).

## Building and Running

To build and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler, such as g++:

   ```bash
   g++ -o bst bst.cpp
